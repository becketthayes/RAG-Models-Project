## Overview

Retrieval-augmented generation is an AI technique that enhances regular LLMs by providing them will relevant, domain-specific information. This grounds the LLMs in the provided knowledge source, making the responses more accurate and reducing the risk of hallucinations. One example usage of RAG Model would be a customer support chatbot, which provides factual information from the knowledge documents it is given.

The **Rag Builder** app is a site designed to provide powerful and custom Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models to users. Users can build as many RAG models as they would like, tailoring them to different domains or genres. The LLMs (in this case Gemini) are then able to respond with factual information that is relevant to the users' documents.
